# Structured Directory Solution (SDS)

Structured Directory Solution (SDS) gives a directory a structure. Assume you're working on a project.
And the project is given a directory. And this directory contains files:

```
intro.txt, a.txt, README.txt, d.txt, v.txt
```

Using a typical file manager or a terminal command, these files can only be organized in any of the
two ways:

```
a.txt, d.txt, intro.txt, README.txt, v.txt
[ascending order]
```
**OR**

```
v.txt, README.txt, d.txt, intro.txt, a.txt
[descending order]
```

However, if you want something more organized, a solution like SDS is what you turn to. With SDS,
the project directory can be organized into something like this:

```
README.txt, intro.txt, a.txt, d.txt, v.txt
[This is clearly a more intuitive organization of the directory.]
```

SDS allows you to organize your directories in anyway. And it is platform independent, meaning  your
directory can maintain its organization, as you copy it from one computer to another. SDS is an open
standard for organizing directories.
