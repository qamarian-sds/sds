Structured Directory Solution (SDS) gives a directory a structure. Assume you're working on a project.
And the project is given a directory. And this directory contains files:

```
intro.txt, a.txt, README.txt, d.txt, v.txt
```

Using a typical file manager or a terminal command, these files can only be organized in any of the
two ways:

```
a.txt, d.txt, intro.txt, README.txt, v.txt
[ascending order]
```
**OR**

```
v.txt, README.txt, d.txt, intro.txt, a.txt
[descending order]
```

However, if you want something more organized, a solution like SDS is what you turn to. With SDS,
the project directory can be organized into something like this:

```
README.txt, intro.txt, a.txt, d.txt, v.txt
[This is clearly a more intuitive organization of the directory.]
```

__SDS allows you to organize your directories in anyway. And it is platform independent, meaning your
directories can maintain their organization, as you copy them from one computer to another. SDS is
an open standard for organizing directories.__
