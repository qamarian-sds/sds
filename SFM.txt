SDS File Manager (SFM)

The SDS File Manager (SFM) is a CLI file manager for structured directories (sirectories). It is
available for all major operating systems. Just download an appropriate binary and start using.

Displaying Contents of A Structured Directory (Sirectory)

	NOTES
	PWD would mean user's present working directory.
	Hidden file would mean file starting with ".".

	sfm x // Displaying contents of pwd, in horizontal manner
	sfm y // Displaying contents of pwd, in vertical manner
	sfm xa // Contents of pwd (including hidden files), in horizontal manner
	sfm ya // Contents of pwd (including hidden files), in vertical manner

	sfm {Valid unix file-path} x // Directory which isn't pwd, in horizontal manner
	sfm {Valid unix file-path} y // Directory which isn't pwd, in vertical manner

	sfm {Valid unix file-path} xa // Directory which isn't pwd (including hidden files), in
		horizontal manner
	sfm {Valid unix file-path} ya // Directory which isn't pwd (including hidden files), in
		vertical manner

Creating New Files and Subdees

SFM allows you to create new files and (sub-directories) subdees at:

	- the beginning of the dir;
	- the end of the dir;
	- the front of another file/subdee;
	- the back of another file/subdee

	sfm nf {New file name} a // Creating file at the beginning of the dir
	sfm nf {New file name} z // Creating file at the end of the dir
	sfm nf {New file name} f {Old file name} // Creating file in front of another file/subdee
	sfm nf {New file name} b {Old file name} // Creating file at the back of another file/subdee
	sfm nf {New file name} // Creating file without bothering about position

	sfm nd {New subdee name} a // Creating subdee at the beginning of the dir
	sfm nd {New subdee name} z // Creating subdee at the end of the dir
	sfm nd {New subdee name} f {Old file name} // Creating subdee in front of another
		file/subdee
	sfm nd {New subdee name} b {Old file name} // Creating subdee at the back of another
		file/subdee
	sfm nd {New subdee name} // Creating subdee without bothering about position

Moving Files and Subdees

SFM allows you to move files and subdees about. Movements can only be performed within the present
working directory. Files and subdees can be moved to:

	- the beginning of the dir;
	- the end of the dir;
	- the front of another file/subdee;
	- the back of another file/subdee;
	- n steps to the left of current position;
	- n steps to the right of current position

	sfm mv {File name or subdee name} a // Moving to The Beginning of The Dir
	sfm mv {File name or subdee name} z // Moving to The End of The Dir
	sfm mv {File name or subdee name} f {Other file} // Moving to The Front of Another
		File/Subdee
	sfm mv {File name or subdee name} b {Other file} // Moving to The Back of Another
		File/Subdee

	sfm mv {File name or subdee name} -2 /* Moving n Steps to The Left of Current Position
		Assuming we have files:
			a.txt, b.txt, c.txt, d.txt
		Running the command above (for "d.txt") would rearrange the dir into:
			a.txt, d.txt, b.txt, c.txt */

	sfm mv {File name or subdee name} +2 /* Moving n Steps to The Right of Current Position
		Assuming we have files:
			a.txt, b.txt, c.txt, d.txt
		Running the command above (for "a.txt") would rearrange the dir into:
			b.txt, c.txt, a.txt, d.txt */

Directory Segregation

In traditional file managers, files and directories are often segregated. That is, the subdees are
listed before or after listing the files in the dir.

	E.g.: a (file), d (file), f (file), B (dir), C (dir), Z (dir)
	E.g.: E (dir), S (dir), W (dir), r (file), t (file), y (file)

SFM however allows files and directories to mix freely. For example, the examples above can
respectively be the following:

	E.g.: a (file), B (dir), C (dir), d (file), f (file), Z (dir)
	E.g.: E (dir), r (file), S (dir), t (file), W (dir), y (file)

Assuming the files and subdees in your dir are mixed, the following command can be used to
segregate them:

	sfm sg da // Directories would be listed after files.
	sfm sg db // Directories would be listed before files.

Desegregating a Segregated Dir

	sfm ds

Moving Files and Subdees (Revisited)

If command "sfm mv {File name} a" or "sfm mv {File name} z" is performed for a file in a structured,
dir the file would be placed at the beginning of the files section, not necessarily the beginning of
the dir. The same goes for subdees.

Getting An SDS Dir's Basic Info

How can you know if an SDS directory is segregated? How can you know what ordering an SDS dir in
under? How can you learn some basic info about an SDS dir? Well, by issuing the command:

	sfm di
