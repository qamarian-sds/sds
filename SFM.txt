SDS File Manager (SFM)

The SDS File Manager (SFM) is a CLI file manager for structured directories (sirectories). It is
available for all major operating systems. Just download an appropriate binary and start using.

Displaying Contents of A Sirectory (Structured Directory)

	NOTES
		PWD would mean user's present working directory.
		Hidden file would mean file starting with ".".

	sfm x // Displaying contents of pwd, in horizontal manner
	sfm y // Displaying contents of pwd, in vertical manner
	sfm xa // Contents of pwd (including hidden files), in horizontal manner
	sfm ya // Contents of pwd (including hidden files), in vertical manner

	sfm {Valid unix file-path} x // Directory which isn't pwd, in horizontal manner
	sfm {Valid unix file-path} y // Directory which isn't pwd, in vertical manner

	sfm {Valid unix file-path} xa // Directory which isn't pwd (including hidden files), in
		horizontal manner
	sfm {Valid unix file-path} ya // Directory which isn't pwd (including hidden files), in
		vertical manner

Creating New Files and Subdees

SFM allows you to create new files and (sub-directories) subdees at:

	- the beginning of the dir;
	- the end of the dir;
	- the front of another file/subdee;
	- the back of another file/subdee

	sfm nf {file name} a // Creating file at the beginning of the dir
	sfm nf {file name} z // Creating file at the end of the dir
	sfm nf new.txt f old.txt // Creating file in front of another file/subdee
	sfm nf new.txt b old.txt // Creating file at the back of another file/subdee
	sfm nf {file name} // Creating file without bothering about position

	sfm nd {subdee name} a // Creating subdee at the beginning of the dir
	sfm nd {subdee name} z // Creating subdee at the end of the dir
	sfm nd newDir f oldDir // Creating subdee in front of another file/subdee
	sfm nd newDir b oldDir // Creating subdee at the back of another file/subdee
	sfm nd {subdee name} // Creating subdee without bothering about position

Moving Files and Subdees

SFM allows you to move files and subdees about. Movements can only be performed within the present
working directory. File and subdees can be moved to:

	- the beginning of the dir;
	- the end of the dir;
	- the front of another file/subdee;
	- the back of another file/subdee;
	- n steps to the left of current position;
	- n steps to the right of current position

	sfm mv {file or dir name} a // Moving to The Beginning of The Dir
	sfm mv {file or dir name} z // Moving to The End of The Dir
	sfm mv b.txt f a.txt // Moving to The Front of Another File/Subdee
	sfm mv a.txt b c.txt // Moving to The Back of Another File/Subdee

	sfm mv d.txt -2 /* Moving n Steps to The Left of Current Position
		Assuming we have files:
			a.txt, b.txt, c.txt, d.txt
		Running the command above would rearrange our dir into:
			a.txt, d.txt, b.txt, c.txt */

	sfm mv a.txt +2 /* Moving n Steps to The Right of Current Position
		Assuming we have files:
			a.txt, b.txt, c.txt, d.txt
		Running the command above would rearrange our dir into:
			b.txt, c.txt, a.txt, d.txt */

Ordering Files and Subdees

SFM allows you to sort the contents of a directory. However, unlike traditional file managers which
support only sorting in ascending and descending order, SFM supports some other types of sorting.
SFM supports six types of sorting:

	ASCBEF (Pronounced as ass-beef): (Ascending-order, with numbers before alphabets)
		E.g.: 01, 2, 3, a, B, c, d
	ASCTER (Pronounced as ass-ter):  (Ascending-order, with numbers after alphabets)
		E.g.: A, B, c, D, 0, 2, 03
	ASCCOD (Provounced as ass-code): (Ascending-order, with whole sorting based on unicode
		codepoint)
		E.g.: 0, 02, 0a, 1, Ea, bd
	DESBEF (Pronounced as des-beef): (Descending-order, with numbers before alphabets)
		E.g.: 03, 2, 1, D, c, B, a
	DESTER (Pronounced as des-ter):  (Descending-order, with numbers after alphabets)
		E.g.: d, c, B, a, 3, 03, 1
	DESCOD (Pronounced as des-code): (Descending-order, with whole sorting based on unicode
		codepoint)
		E.g.: bd, Ea, 1, 0a, 02, 0

Note: In ASCBEF, ASCTER, DESBEF, and DESTER, alphanumeric characters would take precedence over
other characters.

	E.g.: a, b, 1, 4, .gitattribute, -someFile

Before explaining how to sort a dir, using SFM, let's play around some other things first.

Directory Segregation

In traditional file managers, files and directories are often segregated. That is, the subdees are
listed before or after listing the files in the dir.

	E.g.: a (file), d (file), f (file), B (dir), C (dir), Z (dir)
	E.g.: E (dir), S (dir), W (dir), r (file), t (file), y (file)

SFM however allows files and directories to mix freely. For example, the examples above can
respectively be the following:

	E.g.: a (file), B (dir), C (dir), d (file), f (file), Z (dir)
	E.g.: E (dir), r (file), S (dir), t (file), W (dir), y (file)

Assuming your files and subdees in your dir are mixed, the following command can be used to
segregate them:

	sfm sg da // Directories would be listed after files.
	sfm sg db // Directories would be listed before files

Desegregating a Segregated Dir

	sfm ds

Getting An SDS Dir's Basic Info

How can you know if an SDS directory is segregated? How can you know what ordering an SDS dir in
under? How can you learn some basic info about an SDS dir? Well, by issuing the command:

	sfm di

Ordering Files and Subdees (Revisited)

If an SDS dir is unsegregated, the following commands can be used:

	sfm od ascbef // For ASCBEF ordering
	sfm od ascter // For ASCTER ordering
	sfm od asccod // For ASCCOD ordering
	sfm od desbef // For DESBEF ordering
	sfm od dester // For DESTER ordering
	sfm od descod // For DESCOD ordering

To order the subdees of a segregated dir:

	sfm do ascbef // For ASCBEF ordering
	sfm do ascter // For ASCTER ordering
	sfm do asccod // For ASCCOD ordering
	sfm do desbef // For DESBEF ordering
	sfm do dester // For DESTER ordering
	sfm do descod // For DESCOD ordering

To order the files of a segregated dir:

	sfm fo ascbef // For ASCBEF ordering
	sfm fo ascter // For ASCTER ordering
	sfm fo asccod // For ASCCOD ordering
	sfm fo desbef // For DESBEF ordering
	sfm fo dester // For DESTER ordering
	sfm fo descod // For DESCOD ordering
